History of Java

In 1991, Sun Microsystems engineer James Gosling and his team (called the Green Team) started the Green Project.
The aim was to make a smart remote control, but the project failed.
After that, they created a new programming language and first named it Oak (1991–1995), because there was an Oak tree outside Sun Microsystems’ office.
But the name Oak was already registered, so they called it Silk (because of smoothness).
Later, they decided the final name Java, inspired by the Java Island in Indonesia, from where the they drank popular coffee.
   - That’s why the coffee cup logo was chosen.
In 1995, Sun Microsystems officially released Java.
Java is based on the principle of WORA (Write Once, Run Anywhere).


Features of Java

Portability – Java programs can run on any machine because of JVM (heart of java).
Robustness – Strong memory management and exception handling make it reliable.
Garbage Collector – Automatically removes unused objects from memory.
Platform Independent – Same code can work on different platforms.
Object-Oriented – Everything in Java is treated as objects.
